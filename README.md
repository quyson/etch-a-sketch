In this project, I've learned multiple skills regarding manipulating the DOM with javascript. Naturally, this project has me apply concepts such as utilizing event listeners, selecting elements for manipulation, and generating functionality through user input. With these skills, I was able to create a fully-working etch-a-sketch website that allows users to draw images by converting each pixel within the board to a certain color when the mouse hovers over. Additionally, I've added functionality that lets the user control the amount of squares within the board which increases the size and complexity of images able to be drawn. And lastly, I've added multiple buttons that can change the color to the user's liking as well as a random rainbow button that generates a random color for every square that is hovered over with the mouse.
